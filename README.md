# User Authentication System

This **User Authentication System** is a web-based application that provides a secure way for users to register, log in, and manage sessions. Built with Flask, bcrypt, and JWT, this project demonstrates fundamental concepts in cyber security, such as password hashing and token-based session management. The system is suitable for applications requiring user access control and secure data handling.

## Project Overview

The **User Authentication System** provides secure user registration, login, and logout functionality. It uses bcrypt for hashing passwords and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for managing user sessions. The system can be expanded to support role-based access control and two-factor authentication.

### Key Concepts:

- **Password Hashing**: Uses bcrypt to securely hash and store user passwords.
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Uses JWT tokens for secure, stateless session management.
- **Session Security**: Ensures sessions are securely managed, reducing vulnerability to session hijacking.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create accounts by setting a unique username and password.
- **Secure Login**: Authenticates users using their credentials and provides a JWT token for session management.
- **Password Hashing**: Stores passwords securely using bcrypt hashing.
- **Token-Based Session Management**: Generates a JWT token upon successful login to enable stateless authentication.
- **Flash Messages**: Displays messages for successful registration, login, or errors if input is invalid.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application.
- **bcrypt**: Library for password hashing.
- **PyJWT**: Library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-authentication-system.git
   cd user-authentication-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install Flask, bcrypt, and PyJWT.
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-bcrypt pyjwt flask-sqlalchemy
   ```

3. **Set up Environment Variables** (optional):
   Set the `SECRET_KEY` and `JWT_SECRET_KEY` for secure sessions. You can either set these as environment variables or edit them directly in `config.py`.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web App**:
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the login and registration interface.

## Usage

1. **Registration**:
   - Go to the **User Registration** section on the web page.
   - Enter a unique username and password, then submit the form.
   - A success message confirms successful registration.

2. **Login**:
   - Go to the **User Login** section.
   - Enter your registered username and password, then submit the form.
   - On successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated and displayed. This token can be used to authenticate subsequent requests securely.

### Example

#### Input for Registration
- Username: `johndoe`
- Password: `securepassword123`

#### JWT Token on Successful Login
- `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...`

## Future Enhancements

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement different user roles with specific permissions.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Add additional verification steps, such as email or SMS-based OTP.
- **Email Verification**: Send a verification email to users upon registration.
- **Token Expiration and Refresh**: Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms for session management.
